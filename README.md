# Building interactive Menus in Powershell

This is a Controller module. It uses Write-Host to create a Menu in the console. As the name implies
it builds a CLI menu, however if you think your users might fancy a more GUI like experience, you
should look up a cmdlet named Show-Command. Show-Command will build a GUI for you cmdlet. It will
create a windows form with fields for all your parameters and parametersets.


## Design goals

I have seen to many crappy menus that is a mixture of controller script and business logic. It is in 
essence a wild west out there, hence my ultimate goal is to create something that makes it as easy 
as possible to create a menu and change the way it looks. 

1. Make it easy to build Menus and change them
2. Make it as "declarative" as possible


## Menus

The module supports multiple Menus, however only one Main-Menu. Each menu has a collection of Menu-
Items that the user can choose from. 

Example menu:
![ExamleMenu](/Bin/cliMenu.png)


## Menu options

Currently you can control the following aspects of the menu (they are shared across all menus unless you change
them before showing a sub-menu):

* Choose the char that creates the outer frame of the menu
* Change the color of the frame
* Change the Color and DisplayName for the Menus
* Change the color and Heading for the Menus
* Change the color and Sub-Heading for the Menus
* Change the color and DisplayName for the Menu-Items
* Change the color and footer text for the menus
* Change the Width of the Menu


## Menu-Items

Menu-Items are the elements your users can invoke in your Menu. They have a ScriptBlock and a DisableConfirm 
switch parameter in addition to a Name and DisplayName. With the DisableConfirm parameter, you may selectively 
force the user to confirm the action before it is invoked.


## Validation and return values

The goal of this module is neither. As a toolbuilder you are responsible for validating user
input when they invoke the ScriptBlock associated with the Menu-Item. Any output from the ScriptBlock 
will be written in the console. As you may know, a ScriptBlock may be a small script or a call to 
a cmdlet with parameters. I would suggest that you stick to calling custom or built-in cmdlets and 
design it using the best practice guides from Microsoft in regards to mandatory parameters etc.


## Show-Menu

This is the core cmdlet responsible for building the Menu and displaying it to the user. Executed
without parameters it will display the Main-Menu (remember you can only have one Main-Menu). Nevertheless,
you may also use it to display Sub-Menus by specifying the parameter MenuId which is the index of the
menu. Further you may also invoke a specific Menu-Item in a specific Menu by supplying InvokeItem and MenuId
parameters. If the Menu-Item is defined to confirm with the user before invocation, it will prompt the user
with a confirmation request before execution. You can override this with the -Force parameter to execute it
directly.

## Examples

A menu which uses the Show-Command cmdlet (complete script in [example.ps1](https://github.com/torgro/cliMenu/blob/master/Scripts/Example.ps1)):
![Example1](/Bin/Example1.png)

```powershell
Import-Module .\CliMenu.psd1

Set-MenuOption -Heading "Helpdesk Inteface System" -SubHeading "LOIS by Firstpoint" -MenuFillChar "#" -MenuFillColor DarkYellow
Set-MenuOption -HeadingColor DarkCyan -MenuNameColor DarkGray -SubHeadingColor Green -FooterTextColor DarkGray
Set-MenuOption -MaxWith 60

$newItem1 = @{
    Name = "WriteHost"
    DisplayName = "Launch Write-Host as a GUI"
    Action = { show-command -Name Write-host }
    DisableConfirm = $true
}

$newMenu = @{
    Name = "Main"
    DisplayName = "Main Menu"
}

# Create a new menu Item
$menuItem = New-MenuItem @newItem1

# Create a new menu (first menu will become the main menu)
$mainMenu = New-Menu @newMenu

# Add menu item to the menu named 'main'
$menuItem | Add-MenuItem -Menu main
Clear-Host
Show-Menu
```

An example with a Main-Menu and Sub-Menu:
![Example21](/Bin/Example21.png)
![Example22](/Bin/Example22.png)

```powershell
Import-Module .\CliMenu.psd1

Set-MenuOption -Heading "Helpdesk Inteface System" -SubHeading "LOIS by Firstpoint" -MenuFillChar "#" -MenuFillColor DarkYellow
Set-MenuOption -HeadingColor DarkCyan -MenuNameColor DarkGray -SubHeadingColor Green -FooterTextColor DarkGray
Set-MenuOption -MaxWith 60

$newItem1 = @{
    Name = "WriteHost"
    DisplayName = "Launch Write-Host as a GUI"
    Action = { show-command -Name Write-host }
    DisableConfirm = $true
}

$newMenu = @{
    Name = "Main"
    DisplayName = "Main Menu"
}

# Create a new menu Item
$menuItem = New-MenuItem @newItem1

# Create a new menu (first menu will become the main menu)
$mainMenu = New-Menu @newMenu

# Add menu item to the menu named 'main'
$menuItem | Add-MenuItem -Menu main

$newItem2 = @{
    Name = "GoToSub"
    DisplayName = "Go to submenu"
    Action = { Show-Menu -MenuName SubMenu }
}

# Add a menuitem to the main menu
$mainMenu | New-MenuItem @newItem2 -DisableConfirm

$newItemSubMenu = @{
    Name = "GoToMain"
    DisplayName = "Go to Main Menu"
    Action = { Show-Menu }
}

# Create a new menu (sub-menu) and add a menu-item to it
New-Menu -Name SubMenu -DisplayName "*** SubMenu1 ***" | New-MenuItem @newItemSubMenu -DisableConfirm

clear-host
Show-Menu
```
